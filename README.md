This will be my first 'real' Webpage using HTML in the first place.
It won't look very pretty but I'm confident to use CSS and JS after finishing these lessons.

Lessons learned so far for HTML are paragraphs, lists, links and images.

So in the end, I hope this will be a nice experience and I'm excited to see the results.
